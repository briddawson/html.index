The Home relies solely on public funding to maintain itself. </p>

<p class="custom-text"> After 4 years, the Home moved from an old rented bungalow in Old Klang Road to a new purpose built home, Rumah Hope 1 on the large grounds of Good Hope Lutheran Church in Paramount Garden , PJ. The construction of the home was possible thanks to generous contributions in cash and kind namely from Evangelical Lutheran Church Malaysia , Khalid Aluminium Industries Sdn Bhd, NGOâ€™s the general public and various corporate bodies.

<p class="custom-text"> Taking into account the already subsidized medical and transport costs, the upkeep of one child amounts to RM400.00 per month. Once again, we appeal to corporate bodies and the public for financial assistance to support these children.</p>
